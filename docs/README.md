### Dependencies
[MediaPipe](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe) for high-fidelity tracking of the hand.

The project was developed using Python 3.9 due to MediaPipe having reports of compatibility issues, particularly with Windows and Python 3.11 [(Mediapipe issue #3849)](https://github.com/google/mediapipe/issues/3849)
